# Traveling Salesman
Author's demonstration of algorithm skills. Returns near-shortest circular path of 30 locations. This app mimicks the path finding service used by Amazon delivery vehicles and FedEx. 

Traveling salesman problem related algorithm is computationally intensive. The least desired scenario is sending a request and wait for 5+ minutes. C++ is being used to boost the time taken to process the algorithm. The choice is deliberate to increase the number of requests handled per server.
